# Changelog

- 3.1.1 (2018-12-01)
    * Short-circuit on isValidPatp and isValidPatq when there is no leading
      tilde.

- 3.1.0 (2018-11-16)
    * Exports 'isValidPatp' and 'isValidPatq' functions for checking the
      validity of @p and @q strings.

- 3.0.0 (2018-11-02)
    * Major library cleanup and API simplification.  Eliminates old, dead,
      or redundant code that had accrued over time.  Exposes patp, patp2dec,
      patp2hex, and hex2patp functions as the API core (and similarly for @q).
    * Adds proper in-library documentation, and beefs up the README.
    * Adds property tests for both internals and exposed functions.
    * Standardises output, e.g. by always including a leading tilde in @p
      values.

- 2.0.0 (2018-10-22)
    * Bundle/distribute as CommonJS.

- 1.4.0 (2018-10-10)
    * Add 'eqPatq' function for comparing @q values for equality (i.e., modulo
      leading zero bytes).
